## :bookmark: About

In the company I am currently working in, there is a certain sector that is responsible for loading packages into vehicles. 
These packages have a bar code to determine the destination of the package and the vehicle also has a bar code to verify that 
a certain package must be with a specific vehicle.

The problem is that the bar codes are very large and similar and sometimes the people in charge of the packages ended up 
sending it wrong or forgetting some packages, to get around the situation, my superior (in which he provided the query to the 
company's internal Oracle database) and I developed this project to reduce the chances of errors in loading and unloading 
these packages.
